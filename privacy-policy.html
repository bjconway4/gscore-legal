        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how G-Score ("we", "our", or "the App") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use G-Score, we may collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we receive your email address, name, and profile picture from your authentication provider.</li>

            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Your scores, pub ratings, comments, reviews, and username.</li>
            <li><strong>User ID:</strong> A unique identifier associated with your account.</li>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Your username, profile picture, and scores may appear on public leaderboards within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Pub Discovery:</strong> Your coarse location (if granted) is used temporarily to show nearby pubs. Location is not stored or linked to your identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Interaction Analytics:</strong> We track app usage (features used, scores submitted) to improve the app experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
